## Project Description
Kona Talks is a fun, interactive chat platform that allows users to engage in lively conversations with fictional supervillains. These villains entertain users with witty responses and humorous jokes, creating a unique and playful chatting experience.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt like your daily conversations are just too... *wholesome*? Wish you could chat with someone who revels in mischief and has a really bad sense of humor? We realized there's a serious lack of supervillains available for casual conversation, especially ones who crack corny jokes and act like an arch-nemesis.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter *Kona Talks*, the chat platform that lets you connect with the ultimate supervillain—one who's sarcastic, menacing (in a funny way), and ready to serve up evil puns and terrible jokes. With *Kona Talks*, you can chat with a villain who’s equal parts sinister and silly, solving absolutely nothing... but making it a lot more fun!
